Historical release notes for cat(a)log. The current version lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-10-20

### Added
- A poster can be taken down and another put up (#85). "Flier hangs here" on a cat's page records a flier position where the phone is, like "Seen here now" records a sighting; a hold on the map asks, after the cat, whether it was seen here or its poster hangs here. Every poster still hanging is a square pin on the map, not only the latest; a hold on a pin offers "Flier taken down", which removes that position like any history row, so the pin goes and the history keeps the row with its arrow back. On the desk a right-click on a flier pin takes the poster down, the map's right-click offers the flier beside the sighting, and the cat page's Actions menu has "Flier hangs here" with the position picked on the map; the desk shows every poster as a pin without the stray area switched on.

### Fixed
- The desk opens where it was left, not only as large as it was left; a window dragged off the screen's top left is not remembered there.
- The desk records a Moment before a Merge, as the phone does, so a wrong merge can be gone back on from the Moments page.

### Changed
- Every page on the phone has the same top bar: the buttons on their own row, the title under them. A page's actions stand on the bar as long as it has room, and only what does not fit goes into the ⋮ menu, which is gone when nothing is in it: the clowder page shows Hide, Merge and Delete on the bar, a landscape phone or a tablet shows the cat page's whole menu, and an action in the menu wears its icon beside its words.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- A chore can be one time: "One time" is a fourth choice next to daily, every… and weekdays, with an optional due date. It offers Duplicate and End, not Pause. An older app shows a one-time chore on its due day only and leaves it as it is.
- A one-time chore stands in today's chores from the day it is made until it is done, never under Coming up. Due or overdue it moves to the top, red when overdue; until then it waits at the bottom by its due date, saying "Due in 2 days" in orange from three days before. Done, it stays crossed out for the day and is gone the next. It has no streak and no week dots, and one still waiting does not keep the day from being all done.
- A one-time chore with reminders on reminds once, on its due day at its time; without a due date it does not remind.
- The desk has one-time chores too: a fourth radio in its chore editor with an optional due date, today's order on the agenda, the dashboard and the cat's page, red when overdue and orange when due within three days, no Pause and no week dots, and the due date in its calendar.

### Changed
- Frames kept from a video — for a cat or a new stray — offer the crop step one after the other before they are stored, cut from the frame at the video's full size. A cat cut out of a 4K video keeps far more detail than when cropped later from the stored photo. "Use full photo" keeps a frame whole; Cancel drops only that frame.
- When a flier gives no ran-away date, its "Missing since" tile says "Not found on the flier — today" with a warning sign, so a guessed day no longer looks like one that was read. On phone and desk.
- A move in a cat's history — moved home, ran away, adopted — opens the move dialog on a tap, set to that move's home and day, and corrects where to and when. A home's history does the same for a cat's arrival or departure. Before, a move could only be removed.
- An appointment or a chore in a history opens its own editor on a tap, and a chore's done day opens that chore's log. Before, these rows could only be removed there.
- On the desk, a cat's timeline opens the move dialog on a click on a move and corrects where to and when; a home's timeline now lists its cats' arrivals and departures, which correct the same way. Appointments and chores open their editors from there, a chore's done day its log.
- Choosing one of several options is a list of radio buttons, one per line, instead of a row of pills: how often a chore comes around, how long the Archive waits, and the graph's range on phone and desk; the phone graph's Smoothed and Trend are checkboxes.

### Fixed
- A hand-made flier finds its ran-away date: a line saying "weggelaufen am", "entlaufen", "vermisst seit", "verschwunden seit", "missing since" or "lost on" gives the date on it or on the line right after it. Before, only the TASSO poster layout was read, and a hand-made flier's cat went missing today. On phone and desk.
- A flier added to a cat you already have, with its home picked, dates the cat's move home and its running away to the flier's day, and shows the "Missing since" tile to check it. Before, both moves were dated the day the flier was added.
- Merging two cats no longer moves the merged cat back home. The most recent move of either cat, by its own date, decides where it is, so a flier's stray keeps its ran-away day when merged into the cat already in the catalog. On phone and desk.
- Correcting a planned reminder in a history keeps it a reminder; before, the corrected plan turned into a plain value. On phone and desk.
- A flier reads more of the ways people write a date by hand: 03-10-2025, 03.10.25, "3. Oktober 2025", "Oct 3, 2025", and 3.10. without a year, which counts as the latest such day that has already passed. On phone and desk.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-10-01

### Changed
- The F-Droid repository is now called "paxel's apps" and also carries chaos-alert; the address stays the same.

### Fixed
- Looks offer each species only what it has, on phone and desk. A bird's features are a missing leg or toes, an injured or clipped wing, and its eyes — no ears, front legs or teeth. A tortoise gets shell colours and a damaged shell instead of fur colours, marks and teeth. Horses and ferrets get fur, tail and ears like the other furred animals. An animal of unknown species can pick from every feature.
- Adding a stray from a video picks a video file, the same as adding photos from a video to a cat, instead of opening the camera.
- The Strays help no longer says to press and hold Stray Cam to film a video; it points to "From video…" instead.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Everything on one spot of the map shares one pin, on the phone and on the desk: two homes at one address, a cat seen at a home's door, a poster's spot. The pin wears the home's cover — or the freshest face — with "+2" for the rest, and opens the list of what is there; a tap on a row opens it, the map icon on the row puts its trail on the map. Cats already shared a pin; homes, fliers and own location fields now join in.

### Fixed

- The unit system in Settings is three rows with a radio each; the one-line pill squeezed its labels into a tall blob on a phone.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- The card a keeper shares says how old the cat is beside its birth date, and for a cat that has died the age it reached, marked with the cross — the same as on the cat's own page, on phone and desk.
- The vet report's age counts to the day a cat died instead of to today, and carries the cross. So does the Age column of the desk's Cats table.

### Fixed
- "Move to another catalog" on marked rows moves the rows that were marked. It used to offer whole homes and strays instead, so moving five cats out of a home meant moving the home. A cat whose home stays behind arrives as a stray rather than in a home that is not there.
- A phone that syncs but records nothing for a week is no longer treated as an install that is gone: its warning stays and the whole-history file it reads is kept, instead of being cut off for good. Only a file nobody has written to for a week counts as gone, and a folder that cannot say when a file was written — an Android shared folder — keeps everyone.
- The mother or father already written down stays on the picker's list even after that cat's gender is corrected, so the relation can be changed instead of only cancelled.
- Opening a cat while the desk shows homes only puts the card on the desk and lets the filter go, instead of swallowing the click until the filter is found and turned off. A face in the dock brings its card back the same way, and Tile arranges the cards in sight and leaves the hidden ones where they lie.
- A paused chore is off the agenda's calendar; the month grid used to print it on every day while the list filed it under Paused.
- A note that follows a failure is drawn as news again and fades by itself; later notes used to inherit the red ground and the close button of the failure before them. A failure of its own — a photo that could not be read, a catalog whose keepsake file could not be written, an archive or a calendar file that failed — now waits for the x instead of fading after six seconds.
- A moment's sound, the confetti switch and the reminder's voice are the device's own: they are the same in every catalog on phone and desk, and an own sound picked in one catalog no longer replaces another's file behind its back. A choice made before this release is read where it was made.
- Turning the chore reminder's cat sound off is no longer undone by ticking a chore in another catalog.
- The vet report's preview on the desk speaks the app's units and counts from the app's day, so it says what the written report says.
- "Copy graph as image" is offered only when the chosen range actually draws a graph; it used to be clickable and do nothing.
- The year arrows in the agenda's month picker lead back where they came from: a year back from 31 March is 31 March, not 28 February.
- A place near the edge of a map tile is drawn undistorted on the card, with the pin on the place itself instead of always in the middle.
- Deleting an achievement takes it off the list: it is waved off at the tier shown, so a ladder that climbed through a sync no longer comes straight back, and one that was never recorded goes too.
- Deleting an empty catalog says there was nothing to back up instead of naming a keepsake file that was never written.
- Saving picked video frames no longer hangs on a spinner when a full-size frame cannot be read; the picked picture is kept instead. A frame that cannot be grabbed leaves Keep this frame working, rather than dead for the rest of the picking.
- Pulling a tiled card's bottom edge changes that card's height instead of snapping it back to the tile's row, so a card no longer shrinks with every pull and the cards beside it keep theirs.
- The vet report's preview follows every change again: a new date range, the patient summary switch and a row taken out all redraw it, not only the field chips. Drawing it no longer greys out Share and Print.
- An appointment can no longer be saved with nobody to visit; Save stays grey until a cat or a home is picked.
- Turning the adoption confetti off no longer silences the tick, the day's chores, the ladder and the adoption sounds as well. A device that had the switch off before the moments had their own sounds keeps its silence: it is read once as the choice for every moment.
- A marked home is highlighted in the Clowders table again; the row was marked but looked like any other.
- Moving marked cats that are not all in the same home now starts with nothing ticked, and any choice — the street included — can be saved. The street used to look ticked and Save stayed grey.
- Marked rows stay in the catalog they were marked in. They used to survive a switch, and a bulk action — a delete above all — would then be aimed at cats the new catalog has never heard of.
- The plus on a wide screen fans its ways out under itself again: in the two-pane layout they were drawn a pane's width to the left, over the list.
- Deleting a catalog takes the one the question names. Looking at another catalog on the Catalogs page could leave that one marked, and the delete from Settings then took it instead of the one it had asked about.
- "Move in from another catalog" works with three catalogs or more; it used to do nothing at all, throwing where nobody could see it.
- Settling a conflict in the window that lists what arrived leaves the window open, with the conflicts still to settle in it. It used to close on the first choice.
- What arrives from a phone or a folder shows up at once: a sync wrote the entries but never told the views, so the cats, the dashboard, the agenda and the family tree went on showing the catalog as it was before it.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- A Family view on the desk, beside the other views: every cat with kin as its face and its name, grouped by the month it was born in, oldest at the top, a line drawn between a kitten and its mother or father, and the cats whose birth day nobody wrote down last under a question mark. A face opens that cat.
- The agenda is a list beside a calendar now, not three tabs: the plans on the left, a month or a week on the right. The week lays the day out hour by hour with an all-day band above it and a line across the time it is; the month gives every day a cell with its all-day things first and the timed ones under them, recurring chores on every day they are due. Back, forward, Today and a month picker steer it, and an entry opens the cat or the home it belongs to.
- A preview on the desk's document pages: the Card as the picture it becomes, updating as values are ticked on and off, and what will be printed on the missing poster and the vet report.
- The vet report on the phone is previewed as it will print, the way the missing poster already was.
- Marking several rows and moving them into another home in one go, from either table.
- A card on the desk is made taller or shorter by dragging its bottom edge, and keeps that height.
- A home's card can lay every pet living in it on the desk at once and tile them.

### Fixed
- The card copied as a picture wraps its values instead of running them off the right edge on one line, and the sheet is as tall as what it holds instead of half a page of white.
- The red line of text at the top of a view is gone: what the app has to say is a note at the top of the window, which goes by itself when it only says a job is done, and stays with a × when something failed.
- Copying a card, a photo or a graph answers with a green paw at the pointer instead of a word in the corner — and the phone's paw appears at last: it went into whatever overlay was nearest, so a paw asked for inside a dialog vanished with the dialog.
- The timeline opens at once: it used to walk the whole log again on every frame, which made it unusable on a real catalog.
- The desk's graph offers the phone's ranges — week, month, year, all and a custom from/to — and writes them under the phone's own setting, so a catalog opened on either shows what was picked on the other.
- The home a cat is in now is named plainly in the Move dialog; it used to carry a tick this font has not, which drew as an empty box.

### Changed
- The page behind Edit is cut into tabs — Fields, Photos, Plans and Family, and Fields, Cats and Plans for a home — instead of one long scroll. The tab last used comes back with the next page.
- Every dialog on the desk confirms on the right, with Cancel beside it.
- The value editor reads as a dialog now: room around its content, the value, the date it counts from and the private mark kept apart.
- Checkboxes on the desk are squares that cross themselves off, instead of a tick too small to recognise.
- Marking rows in the Cats or Clowders table is worth something now: the marked rows carry a menu — open them all on the desk, move them into another home or another catalog, hide or show them, export them into one file, delete them after one question — and a tick on a marked row speaks for every marked row.
- A card's rows are separated by a hairline instead of alternating colours, and the body's scrollbar floats over them, so the card is one shape from the title bar down.
- Stack lays the pile in the cascade's order: the card highest up is furthest back.
- The card's menu says "Move to another home" instead of "Move to", and no longer offers "Seen here now" — a desk has no here.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- Week and Month views on the desk's agenda, beside the list it already had: the appointments, reminders and due chores laid out on their days, a step back and forth and a way home to today, and an entry that opens the cat or the home it belongs to.
- A Catalogs page on the desk: every catalog on this device on the left, what can be done with the chosen one on the right — create, open, rename, delete, and the shared folder with a way to stop sharing it. The catalog entries in the menu are gone; the menu opens the page.
- Two more sounds to pick from for any moment, on the phone and the desk: Sonne miau and Sonne purr, a second cat's voice.
- A cat or a home can be renamed from its card on the desk: the pen beside the name on the title bar.
- A home's card chooses which Fields it shows, as a cat's card already did.
- A number measured more than once draws its course under the value on the card — the weight at a glance, without opening the history.
- An address can be searched when a place is set on the desk: type it, press Search, pick the match. The lookup runs only when asked, never while typing.
- Every free-text Field on the desk takes as many lines as the keeper writes, not only Remarks.
- Buttons for closer, further and pin by pin on the desk's map, beside the search and the stray areas it already had; the location picker gets the zoom buttons too.
- Shift and drag on the desk's map draws a box and zooms into it; a plain drag still pans.
- A calendar on the desk's field editor: a date is picked from the month rather than spelled out, and can still be typed.
- A place on a card shows where it is: the coordinates with their Plus Code, a picture of the spot on the map and the code a phone reads to go there, in place of the words "On the map".

### Changed
- The history graph on the desk takes a time range — one month, six months, a year or everything — and the smoothed curve replaces the measured line instead of being drawn over it.
- The card's menu says Edit, because the page behind it is where a cat or a home is edited, and offers Timeline beside it: everything that ever happened to that one, in a window of its own instead of a fold at the foot of the page.
- The Mother and Father pickers on the desk offer only cats that could be one — a male cat is no longer offered as a mother and then refused. A cat whose gender is unknown is still offered.
- A card on the desk lists only the Fields the cat or the home actually has a value for, and every value is changed by the pen on its row, which opens the ordinary field editor — so a private mark and a date picker are there wherever the value is edited. A button under the rows fills in a Field that is still empty. A long value wraps over as many lines as it needs, and a card whose body outgrows the desk scrolls inside itself instead of growing past the edge. Every row is as wide as the card, so the stripes no longer stop halfway across, and the card's outline is visible against its own title bar.

### Fixed
- The desk's map zooms in as deep as the tiles go, keeps the place under the pointer where it was while zooming, and the wheel gathers before it steps a level, so a brush of the wheel no longer throws the view out to the whole world.
- A ticked chore in the desk's history names the chore — "Feed done" instead of "Chore done" — and no longer repeats the date the line beside it already carries.
- A Field's history on the desk reads as a diary: the day stands over what was written on it, and a long value wraps instead of stretching the window past both edges of the screen.
- Tile on the desk fits every card into its cell — a card with more in it than the cell holds scrolls inside it instead of being laid out of reach. Tile lays a real grid: columns from the desk's width, rows sharing what is left above the dock. It used to start the second row below the tallest card, which pushed those cards off the desk, where egui pinned them and no hand could drag them back. No card is ever laid down past the desk's edge now, whichever way it was arranged.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- A chore's reminder says Mrrr: the notification carries Socke's call instead of the phone's own sound, and the desk speaks it with its popup. A switch under Sounds on both Settings pages turns it back to the system's sound.
- Three more sounds to pick from for any moment, on the phone and the desk: Meep, Mrrp and Mrrr, the calls of a cat called Socke.

### Removed
- The Meow sound. Meep takes its place as the sound of a ticked chore, and the chorus for a ladder climbed is now made of Socke's three calls instead of three borrowed meows. A device that had Meow picked for a moment hears that moment's own sound again.
- The desk's cards wear a title bar like a window: the name, × to close, ⋮ with the menu. A dock floats at the bottom of the desk while cards lie there: Tile lays them out in rows, Stack cascades them, Close all clears the desk, and one face per open card brings that card to the front, the one on top marked with a dot.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- An achievement can be deleted: hold it on the phone, right-click or the ⋮ on the desk. For a chore's typo or a ladder nobody wants. It stays gone until the ladder climbs past the tier it was waved off at, which counts as new.

### Removed
- The CSV export on the phone's home menu. One flat row per cat was no export of a catalog; what an export should hold is an open question, and nothing stands in its place until it is answered.

### Changed
- The sync folder deletes nothing on another device's behalf any more. 2.0.2 removed the whole-history file of an install gone quiet for a week; now such a file stays where it is, nobody is named for it, and the live devices drop the frozen files they kept for it. A reader that arrives later reads it and moves on.
- Picking frames from a video is a page of its own with the video playing in it: the slider seeks the picture as the finger moves, play and pause, steps of one frame, one second and ten seconds either way, held to repeat, and "Keep this frame" takes the exact frame at the player's position. The kept frames line up at the bottom, a tap lets one go. The guessed "suggested frames" are gone; the scrubber that showed a frame only after the finger came to rest, half a second later, is gone with them.

### Fixed
- A fresh cat's page no longer opens with the plus fanned out; it fanned from where the "Create" button had been, its items over the app bar. The plus stays a plus until tapped, and while the fan is out the minus stands lit above the veil instead of darkened under it.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- The portrait of a deceased cat wears the Trauerflor, a black band across its lower right corner: on the avatar in every list, the map pin, the card, and on the desk's faces, rows and tiles. On the placeholder too, so a cat without a photo reads as deceased. The other photos stay as they are.
- A history row with a position carries a map icon: the map opens on that spot with the trail drawn and that value's dot marked.
- Typed fields in the value editor (remarks, numbers, unit values, ids) carry an X that empties them, so a fresh note starts blank without selecting and deleting the old one first.
- Holding a trail dot on the map opens its menu right there: the value's history, a correction where the field has an editor, and removal. Holding the map itself offers the strays for a sighting in a menu at the finger.

### Changed
- The desk's Home and Agenda are laid out in cards: every section is a rounded card with its heading, and a chore, appointment or reminder is a two-line row inside it, the tick box or Finish at its side, whose it is with the face on the second line. Recent changes are grouped by day, Today and Yesterday by name, older days by weekday and date, each line with its time and the face of the cat or the cover of the clowder. The "Last viewed" clowder shows its own cover, not a cat's face. Weekday names are translated.
- A reminder or appointment ticked today stays on the agenda for the day, box checked, like a chore. The tick asks nothing; a tap on the done reminder plans the next cycle, a tap on the done appointment reopens its outcome notes, the box unticks, the bin takes it off the list.
- Moving a cat is one dialog: the homes and "stray" as rows, the day at the foot for a historic move.
- Creating a catalog asks nothing about moving things in; "Move in from another catalog…" is a row on the catalog's settings page.
- The unit system is picked on the settings row itself, no dialog.
- Nothing slides in from the bottom any more. Every menu opens where the finger is: the photo menu, the cover picture's menu, the catalog switcher under the title, the map's menus. Help is a page of its own, and shared photos are placed on one page that lists cats, homes with "New cat here", a new stray, and a new home typed right there.
- History rows on the timeline, the field history and the chore log have the agenda shape: a tap corrects, the bin removes, a removed row shows the arrow that brings it back. A chore tick's day and time are corrected in one dialog.
- A chore tick in the history names its chore, and the day it counts for when that is not the day it was ticked.
- A button that says "take a picture" or "from the gallery" no longer asks which one it meant.

### Fixed
- The sync folder no longer names an install that is gone as "still needs the new version" on every start. A whole-history file nobody has written to for a week, whose entries every device already holds, is an old install; phone and desk delete it and its key file, and the live devices drop the frozen files they kept for it. A manifest still on its way from the cloud client no longer counts as a device on the old layout either.
- The desk is usable with a real catalog. It used to ask the database for every value on every frame, and every such read scanned the whole log twice, so a catalog of a thousand cats took ten seconds per frame in the Cats view and half a minute on the agenda. The store now keeps what every read needs between writes, the views keep their rows until something changes, and the reminder check runs twice a minute instead of once a frame.
- The outcome notes of a finished appointment show in the history under the visit; they were stored but shown nowhere.
- On Linux the desk's menu entry shows the cat icon, on KDE as on GNOME. The entry names the icon by its theme name and a 256 pixel PNG sits where every desktop looks; 2.0.1 pointed the entry at an SVG file inside the Homebrew prefix, which drew nothing. The desk also keeps its own launcher entry, icon and `.catsync` file type current in the application menu on every start, so a Homebrew, tarball or AppImage install is in the menu with its icon after one start, and a moved binary heals its entry itself.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-09-21

### Changed
- Every sound has its own setting, on the phone and the desk: a chore ticked, the day's chores done, a ladder climbed, an adoption, each with a list to pick from under Settings, Sounds. The pick is heard as it is made; None is a choice, and so is a sound file of your own. The one Cheer sound switch is gone; a device that had it off stays silent until a moment gets its own sound.
- A clowder's cover picture is one row with the camera and the gallery as buttons, on the phone; the desk's row says what it is beside its button. The explanation and the sheet in between are gone. The strays list leads with the same row for its own picture instead of an icon in the bar.
- One plus on every page that adds in more than one way, fanning the ways out with their words: on the strays list New stray, Take photo, Choose from gallery, From video, Flier from camera and Flier from gallery; on a cat's page Take photo, Choose from gallery, From video, Appointment, Reminder and Chore, fanned out already when a fresh cat's page opens; on a clowder's page Add cat, Appointment, Reminder and Chore; on the agenda the three kinds of plan. The Stray Cam, flier and Add reminder icons in the bars are gone, as is the "Appointment or reminder?" dialog. A Stray Cam picture opens the page in edit mode straight away, species a field on it; the Looks question before the page is gone.
- Every plan editor starts with whose it is, a For field preset from the page it was opened on and changeable; from the agenda it starts with the cat or clowder looked at last. The dialog asking whose came first is gone, also before a duplicated chore.
- The map's Stray Cam button is gone; a stray is added from the strays list.
- A conflict is settled on its row: the two values are buttons with who and when, a tap keeps one. On the conflicts page, on the arrival page, and on the desk's conflicts and arrival views alike; a field's conflict badge leads to the conflicts page. The dialog that asked again is gone, and so is its explanation.
- The agenda's three rows share one shape: the box on the left ticks a chore, marks a reminder done or finishes an appointment, tap opens whose it is, a hold edits it, and a bin on the right removes a reminder or deletes an appointment. The long-press menus on the reminder and appointment cards are gone.
- On a clowder's page a hold on a cat opens its Card straight away; the two-item menu is gone. The agenda's export and its calendar resync are icons in the bar instead of a one-item menu.
- Desk: one menu under cat(a)log holds Settings and Quit in place of File and Edit; the language is picked on Settings only. Merge is a button beside New cat on a clowder's page. A row's menu holds only what a click does not do already, and every row with a menu shows a ⋮ at its end, the chore row included, so the right-click is not the only way in.
- Hosting an in-person sync no longer asks whether the phone that just scanned the code may join: the code and the PIN off the screen are the answer. Always-allowed devices, their list under Authors and the question on the desk are gone with it; the Include private switch stays the one setting a join reads.
- A button that already says camera opens the camera: the flier capture, and the missing poster's picture tiles, which now come as a gallery tile and a camera tile. The flier capture from a cat's page offers the two as buttons on its page.
- Every view on the desk opens with its name as a headline under the bar; Agenda, Map and Vet no longer squeeze theirs into the toolbar.
- The desk's tips look and work like the phone's: one bubble with Skip and Next, Got it on a page's last, Skip ending that page's tips. A tip whose widget is not on screen shows the same bubble under the bar instead of a line under the menu. The intro asks whether the tips are wanted, with Start with the tips and Start without tips under the name, instead of a checkbox.

### Fixed
- On Linux the desk installed through Homebrew is in the application menu right after `brew install`, and its window shows the cat icon on Wayland; before, the menu entry had to be registered by hand and the window carried a generic icon. The `.deb` shows the icon on Wayland too. `catlog-install-icon --uninstall` takes the menu entry out again.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- The desktop app is new, written in Rust, and looks like the phone: the cream from the icon, the cat orange for what is chosen, Noto Sans and the Material icons beside every label. A bar under the menu leads to six views over the same Catalogs, shared folders and `.catsync` bundles the phones use: Home, a dashboard with the counts, what is due today with tick and finish, the recent changes and the cat and clowder looked at last; Cats, a table with columns chosen per Catalog, sorting, search, Strays and Missing filters and multi-select; Clowders, a table with faces, counts and status; Map; Agenda; and Vet, the runs and appointments across all cats with the patient sheet and the report one click away. A cat or clowder opens as its index card on the desk, several side by side, dragged into place and found there again; simple values are edited on the card, complex ones in the editor; every other page opens as a modal that Escape closes. Motion is modest and the Eye candy switch stills it. A chore is duplicated onto another cat or home from its dialog, a clowder gets its cover picture, the map searches cats, clowders, people and places, a new cat comes with a proposed name and the dice for another, and the impossible is refused with the phone's words, as on the phone. A tip rings the widget it is about and speaks beside it. The rest is the phone's: Clowders, Cats and Strays with their Fields, photos with crop and mark, chores with the agenda and desktop reminders, appointments and Vet Runs, the map with sightings and stray areas, the sync pages with the watch line and the conflicts page, duplicates with Merge and Transfer, Moments with going back, automatic backups with restore, archiving, the authors page with bans, the Card, the missing poster with its QR code and the report for the vet as PDFs, flier capture from an image file, achievements with the cheers, tips, help and settings. Linux ships as tar.gz, .deb and AppImage, Windows as a zip through Scoop, macOS as a dmg through the Homebrew cask.
- The desk hosts an in-person sync (#138): Start hosting on the Sync page shows the pair code as a QR and as text with the PIN, a phone joins it as it joins another phone, every unknown phone is allowed once, always or declined, and what arrived opens as after a folder round. The desk serves over its own certificate only while the modal is open.
- Copy as image on the desk (#138): the printed Card from a card's menu and from its document page, a photo full size from the viewer, and the history graph drawn on white ground with its title, range, days and trend, each straight to the clipboard for a messenger or a mail.
- Duplicate in a chore's editor: pick the cat or home the copy is for and a new editor opens with the same title, schedule, time and reminder, over the original, so every kitten gets its feeding with one pick and one Save each.

### Changed
- A shared folder carries a change within a minute while both apps are on screen: every entry written on this phone goes to the folder a few seconds later, gathered with whatever else lands in those seconds, and the folder is looked at every thirty seconds instead of every five minutes. A phone's history in the folder is a run of small segments beside a manifest: only the open segment travels, full ones never again, and a reader takes only the lines it has not seen. A merge the phone ran on its own says nothing but the news notes; the folder out of reach for a while raises one note that stays until dismissed. Phones and the desk write and read the new layout in this release; a device still on the old one keeps what it had and is named until it updates.
- Everything the app has to say now comes at the top of the screen, under the status bar: one note at a time, the page moving down under it, nothing at the bottom where the navigation gestures and the keyboard are. A thin line pulses with one icon per running job while a folder sync, an in-person sync, a backup or an archive runs. A note only says that a job finished, that it failed, or that changes wait: tap a finished sync for what arrived, tap a failure for the cause, the full text and a Report button, swipe left for the next note, swipe right to clear the news; a failure stays until it is swiped left or tapped, a finished job leaves after three seconds. Copied, recorded and cleared no longer announce themselves; a green paw at the tapped button says it worked. The sync pages no longer print entry and photo counts, and a catalog name already taken is answered under the name field. On the arrival page the ticks of one chore are one row with the chore's title and count, and a cat's row names what changed instead of counting changes.
- The cheers are cats now, on the phone and the desk: a short meow when a chore is ticked, a purr when the day's chores are done, a chorus of meows for a ladder climbed, a meow over a purr for an adoption. The recordings come from Wikimedia Commons, CC0 and public domain; the crowd cheers and their credit are gone.
- The flier text page shows one card per line, the text as wide as the page, the target under it; the X or a swipe puts a line aside, Undo brings it back. Links on the text and registry pages and in the remember-service dialog show in full.
- Shared folder sync is several times faster: a round skips the entries it already holds before checking them, and the lookups behind private and merged values are asked once instead of once per entry. A round with nothing new takes a sixth of the time, a first import a little over half.

### Removed
- The Flutter desktop targets. Their data stays where it was; the new app keeps its own data under the same app id in a `v2` folder.

### Fixed
- A battery saver closing the app in the background no longer brings the crash report on the next start. On Android 11 and newer the app asks the system why it was ended and offers the report only after a crash, a freeze, or a memory kill while it was on screen; the report names the system's reason.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-09-15

### Changed
- The line about waiting changes can be swiped away or closed with its X; it comes back when more arrives.

### Fixed
- Photos no longer carry the camera's metadata, so where a picture was taken does not travel to the shared folder; the photos already stored are rewritten without it at the next start. Android alters such files when another app reads them, which is why photos with a location never arrived on a second phone through the folder.
- The Sync button on the shared folder page shows a moving bar and "Syncing with the folder…" until the round is done.
- Photo files that reach the shared folder after the entries are fetched by the next round of the folder watch, without a tap; the sync result says how many photos are not in the folder yet, and why each one that is there could not be taken.
- The line at the top says "Syncing with the folder…" with a progress bar while a tapped sync runs, instead of staying silent until it is done.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-14

### Changed
- Achievements open from the home page's menu instead of a button on the agenda.

### Fixed
- A chore's master achievement says how often the chore was done instead of "reached" with the tick count.
- The help button is the first button in the app bar on the history and timeline pages too.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- Photos shared through a folder on Android no longer show up in the phone's gallery.

### Changed
- The vet report's colour legend sits above the timeline instead of at the end of the patient sheet.
- The missing poster takes pictures straight from the gallery at full size, next to the cat's stored ones; the page holds still while you pinch a frame.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- Shared folder sync watches the folder while the app is on screen: a line at the top of every page says whose changes wait, tap syncs; a second switch merges them on their own and reports in one line.

### Changed
- The missing poster offers every filled field of the cat and its home as a tick, takes up to two photos that you frame by dragging and pinching, shows the page as it will print, and prints a code per ticked ID (registry link) and location (map link) next to the cat(a)log code.
- The report for the vet and the missing poster are buttons on the cat's page, next to the timeline; their pages carry the card page's Share as PDF and Print buttons.
- The graph's range and line choices fold behind one header.
- A home's page shows its chores and appointments right after the cats, before the fields; a cat's page leads with its photos, then its chores, then the fields.

### Fixed
- Every page has the help button: backups, conflicts, all three sync pages, moderation, restore, scan, vet report, poster and achievements got their text.
- The restore page and the strays page keep their actions in the app bar like every other page; strays keep one add button.
- The day picker confirms with Save like every other dialog.
- The history pages keep their title on its own line on a phone, like the cat page.
- The same action wears the same icon on every page: one PDF icon, one share icon, one copy icon.
- Rows that react to a hold on the history, chore history and timeline pages wear the cat ear.
- Dates in the day picker and numbers everywhere follow the device's format: 12.9.2026 and 4,25 in German; a number typed with a comma still graphs.
- Picking a cover picture no longer crashes when the page was rebuilt behind the camera, and no longer asks to draw a rectangle around the animal.
- A tip whose spot lies below the fold scrolls it into view first; the card stays on the screen with its buttons.
- A home's faces keep clear of the favourite star.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- The graph can show a smoothed line with each reading hanging on it, and a dashed trend line with the change per month; both remembered, both in the vet report.
- Six new tips, shown once: chores on a cat's page, Looks after a capture, holding a value in a history, the Backups row, the poster and the report buttons.
- A tick on the name page skips the intro and every tip on this install; Settings brings them back.
- A home, and the strays, can carry a cover picture of the place; the card shows it instead of a cat.
- A star on a home's card marks it a favourite; favourites come first, right after Strays.
- A photo shared into the app can become a new cat in a home of your choice, or in a new home; a shared video goes through the frame picker.
- A report for the vet from a cat's timeline: chosen fields and dates, a patient summary, the entries as a timeline with a colour per field, and a curve per number field, as a PDF.
- A missing poster from the card page: photo, the name in letters for the street, missing since, the home's address, phone in a black band, Looks and a standing text, and a QR code another cat(a)log reads.

### Changed
- A home's card shows a number only past five faces.
- Chores, ticks, titles and privacy marks read as words in the history and the timeline instead of raw data.
- A home's title wears the ear: hold it to rename; in edit mode a tap on the title renames as before.
- Holding a field in read mode opens that one value's editor and leaves the page in read mode.
- Holding a field in edit mode opens its history page; a field without a value has no ear and nothing to hold.
- PDFs print Greek and Cyrillic letters; Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Japanese and Chinese get their font fetched once when first needed.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- A field's or chore's history shares as a PDF and copies as text, instead of sharing a text file.

### Fixed
- Chore reminders work in the store build: the release build had stripped the notification plugin's inner workings, so the test button did nothing and the switch reported a missing permission; a broken plugin now reports itself instead of posing as a refusal.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- A chore's history page: every due day with done when and by whom, missed, or still open; oldest first on request, shareable as text.
- A field's history can be read oldest first and shared as text, one line per value with date and author.
- The graph page shares its curve as a picture, caption and curve only, through the phone's share sheet.
- A title you earned can be worn next to your name, chosen in the catalog settings; partners see it on the author rows, and nobody can wear one in your name.
- Five coats in colour behind the pages, calico to tortoiseshell, one earned per full month of chores; a favourite coat can be pinned in Settings.
- Titles for chores done, Servant to Minister with the chore in brackets, and a new coat for every full month; the achievements page lists what was earned and nothing to chase.
- Looks grew: eye colour, a Features group for what never changes (tipped or tattooed ear, a missing eye or leg, no teeth, extra toes), more colours, patterns, fur, tail and ear types. A shared feature alone makes a match candidate.
- Thirty more cat breeds, Burmese and Abyssinian among them, named in every language; existing catalogs get them added.
- Android backs the catalogs up into the keeper's Google account, photos left out, and puts them back on a reinstall or a new phone.
- On iPhone the backup files show in the Files app under cat(a)log.
- A Backups page in Settings says what the phone backs up where, writes a copy on request, and on Android sends every copy to a folder of your choice too.
- Every value has a time of day: the editor's As of row picks date and time, and the history, the timeline and the graph show it.
- A wrong value can be corrected or removed from its history; hidden values show on request and can be restored.
- A done day in a chore's history can be corrected to another moment or removed.

### Changed
- Reverting a change removes it instead of writing the old value again.
- Android backups go to Documents/catlog instead of Downloads/catlog.

### Fixed
- Restoring after a reinstall works on Android: the restore page opens the picker on the backup folder, and one grant lists every backup there.
- Two devices changing a choice field's option list at the same time get both lists merged instead of a conflict.
- Chores on a cat's or home's page are ordered like the agenda: due today by time, the rest and the paused ones behind a Coming up fold.
- Chore reminders of every catalog stay scheduled; opening another catalog used to cancel them.
- Chore reminders show with their own icon and a sound; a button sends a test reminder at once.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- A chore's gap can be days, weeks, months or years: a vaccine every year, not every 365 days.

### Changed
- One shared folder carries all catalogs: each uses a subfolder named after it, and the folder page explains Syncthing for a folder without a cloud.
- A paused chore stays in sight everywhere, greyed and without its box, until resumed or ended.
- Today's chores are sorted by time, those without a time first; ticked ones grey out.

### Fixed
- Folder sync on Android works in any folder the picker grants, cloud folders included.
- Conflicts are raised only on fields a keeper can judge; two entries with the same value say so instead of showing two chosen boxes.
- History, arrivals and conflicts show a position as coordinates and plus code; privacy markers read as the field's name.
- A paused chore reads "Paused" on the cat's page, not "Pause"; End wears the bin icon.
- Choosing "Every…" for a new chore no longer crashes the editor.
- Ticking the day's last chore on a cat's or home's page celebrates too.
- The cheer clips are loud enough to hear on a phone speaker.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- The chore editor is a page that scrolls; Pause and End are rows at its bottom, End asks once.
- When hosting an in-person sync, the page's private switch decides; the join popup asks no more.
- Chore rows: the checkbox ticks, a tap opens the cat or home, a long-press edits.
- Coming up on the agenda is folded until opened.

### Fixed
- No more crash when the day's last chore is ticked and the cheer plays.
- Crash report mails keep the app's own frames instead of framework noise.
- Ticking a chore on a cat's or home's page no longer turns the row into tomorrow's.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- Every catalog signs its entries with its own key; forged entries in a known name are refused and listed on the arrival page.
- Partners show as name and key code; your key is in the catalog settings.
- Looks: a chip field for size, colours, marks and per-species traits, asked right after a Stray Cam or poster capture.
- Match candidates include pairs whose Looks agree in two traits or more; a wrong pair can be marked "Not the same".
- Chores: recurring care on a cat or home, daily, every N days or on chosen weekdays, with Today and Coming up on the agenda, streaks and week dots.
- Achievements page: full months, years, decades and centuries of chores, and a master ladder per chore.
- A chore can remind you with a phone notification at a chosen time.

### Changed
- The celebration cheer is one of several clips and has its own switch in Settings.

### Fixed
- The map no longer freezes after a swipe.

## [1.1.4] - Unreleased

### Added

- A fresh install offers to restore the catalogs of the install
  before it: the backups now also live in a folder that survives
  uninstalling, and after the name step the app lists them, one per
  catalog, all ticked. Where several files of one catalog exist, all
  are imported, newest first, so an older one can still supply a
  missing photo. The same
  page sits in Manage catalogs as "Restore backups…", with a file
  picker for backups kept elsewhere.

### Changed

- The field chips above a table (columns) and above a card (what is on
  it) fold away behind a header that names the choice and counts it;
  once something is chosen they start folded. The fold is remembered
  per device. A column no shown row has a value for is not offered.

### Fixed

- A photo whose bytes never arrived shows a grey tile saying "Photo
  not received yet" and the same in the viewer, instead of an empty
  square and a black page.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Map pins stay on their spot while zooming: the tip was anchored a
  pin's height below the coordinate and slid over the map.
- Deleting an author's data acts on that author on that one device,
  and the ban is on the device. Before, every author with the same
  name on any device was deleted and the name was banned, so anyone
  could take a name and get its owner wiped. The bans list shows the
  names a banned device wrote under.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- A found address reads the way its country writes addresses: street
  and number, then postcode and town ("Grimmaische Straße 12, 04109
  Leipzig"), number first where that is the custom. Towns and regions
  keep their full name.

### Fixed

- Deleting a catalog or a person's data asks one plain question
  instead of demanding a typed word, which the keyboard completed
  anyway.

- Photos picked from a video appear one by one as they are added,
  with a progress line, instead of all at once after a silent wait.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- A "Conflicts (N)" entry in the main menu while fields changed in two
  places at once are still unsettled; it lists them and each one is
  resolved on the spot.
- A history button on a cat's or home's field once it has held two or
  more values (and has no graph): the values as a diary, newest first,
  with date and author. Reverting stays on the edit-mode timeline.
- Location fields you add yourself pin on the map, as a neutral pin
  with the field's name. Every location has a trail: tap a pin, or
  open the map from the field's row; the dots along the trail show
  date and author when tapped. Homes have trails too.

### Changed

- "Find address on the map" no longer writes silently: a dialog shows
  the place it found and asks whether to save the location and whether
  to replace the typed address with the found wording.
- Language, units, celebrations, notifications and the tutorial
  replays moved from the menu and the About page into a Settings page
  in the main menu.
- Each catalog has its own settings page, opened from its row in the
  catalog switcher: name, cats or pets, fields, authors and bans,
  archive, go back, delete. It works on that catalog whether or not you
  are in it. Those items left the menu, the About page and the top of
  the switcher.
- Deleting a catalog or a person's data asks you to type the word
  shown (DELETE, in your language) instead of the full name.
- Map pins point at their spot: a tip under the face sits on the exact
  coordinate, for cats, posters, homes and grouped pins alike.
- Tapping a home's pin on the map shows its trail, like a cat's; the
  home's page opens from the trail bar's Open button.
- After a sync or import, a full page shows what arrived instead of a
  sheet with "N other changes": new cats and homes, updated ones with
  their effective changes (value before, value now), conflicts to
  resolve on the spot, and what else came along (fields, merges,
  photos). Accept keeps it; Reject puts the catalog back as it was.
  In-person sync can be rejected too. A partner's deletion of a cat
  or home you have is listed under Deleted; "Keep mine" on a deleted
  or updated row keeps your version on this device without touching
  the partner's catalog, and it stays kept over later syncs. Cats and
  homes hidden on this device are not announced.

### Fixed

- Panning the map away from a still-loading tile no longer records a
  crash when the tile arrives.
- The pair code shown for an in-person sync wraps into short lines,
  each in its own colour, instead of running off the screen.
- The fur coat behind a page scrolls with the page instead of staying
  put under the moving content, and each page keeps its own position
  when you come back to it.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Pet mode: on the catalogs page, "This catalog holds: Cats / Pets".
  A pets catalog speaks of pets and households instead of cats and
  clowders, shows a paw for an animal without a photo, and proposes
  neutral names. The choice syncs with the catalog; nothing in the
  data changes. The neutral wording exists in all 38 languages.
- Species is a choice with presets — cat, dog, rabbit, guinea pig,
  hamster, bird, horse, tortoise, ferret, or your own word. In pet
  mode, adding an animal asks for it, starting from the one you picked
  last.
- Breed follows the species: a dog is offered dog breeds, a rabbit
  rabbit breeds, and a breed you type for one species is offered again
  for that species only. Cats keep the breed list as it is.
- A "unit value" field type: pick what it measures — weight, length,
  volume or temperature — and enter and read it in your units (metric
  or imperial, from your region or chosen under Units in the menu)
  while partners see theirs. Weight is ready on every animal.
- A graph for any number or unit-value field with two or more values:
  the icon on the field's row opens it — week, month, year, all or a
  range of your own, the change since the previous value, lowest,
  highest and latest marked, the animal's appointments as ticks.

### Changed

- The pages sit on a quiet fur coat instead of a plain surface: beige
  on beige (dark on dark at night), one of six patterns — cheetah,
  tiger, tabby, paw prints, leopard rosettes, zebra — picked anew each
  time the app opens.

- "Possible stray area" on the map is a dialog with an OK button
  instead of a sheet that could only be closed by tapping beside it.

### Fixed

- On iPhone and iPad, holding Stray Cam to film no longer closes the
  app: filming needs a microphone entry iOS insists on. The sound is
  thrown away; only the frames you pick are kept.
- Joining in-person sync without Wi-Fi says "Connect to a Wi-Fi first"
  right away, instead of a silent 25-second wait with the answer
  hidden below the fold.

### Security

- In-person sync runs over TLS: the host uses a certificate made once
  on the device, the pair code carries its fingerprint (all of it in
  the QR, the first part in the typed code), and the joiner accepts no
  other. Nobody on the same Wi-Fi reads what passes any more. Both
  devices need 1.1.0; an older partner is named as such.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- Stray Cam, the camera and gallery picker, the code scanner, "my
  location", printing, sharing and links run one at a time: a second
  press while one is still working does nothing, and the Stray Cam
  button shows a spinner meanwhile. A plugin error shows its message
  instead of a crash. The Strays help explains tap versus press-and-hold
  on Stray Cam.

### Security

- A shared file or a sync partner can no longer plant entries under
  this device's own id, which would have made partners skip its real
  changes.
- Registry lookup links open only web addresses; a template pointing at
  `sms:`, `tel:` or an app scheme is ignored.
- Imports, syncs and share downloads refuse files and photos far above
  the sizes the app writes, instead of unpacking them into memory.
- In-person sync listens on the Wi-Fi connection only, and an address
  that sends five wrong PINs is locked out for that session.
- "Always allow this device" now rests on a secret the host hands the
  device, not on the device's own name for itself; devices remembered
  by older versions are asked once more.
- Files on their way to a share sheet or the backup folder are written
  to a private, short-lived directory and deleted afterwards.
- The catalogs are excluded from Android and iCloud device backups, as
  the privacy text promises.
- A photo name inside a shared file or from a sync partner can no
  longer point outside the catalog's image folder — reading or
  deleting a photo needs a real hash.

### Fixed

- Backups, shared files and archives with many photos no longer need
  twice the photos' size in memory while being written — the automatic
  backup on leaving the app could kill it on a phone with a big catalog.
- Restoring or importing a file with many photos reads it photo by
  photo instead of unpacking everything into memory first.
- A sync partner that dropped the connection mid-transfer could crash
  the hosting device.
- A photo mentioned in the log that nobody holds any more no longer
  makes every sync between the devices fail; a problem while fetching
  photos no longer hides that the entries arrived.
- "Resync calendar" waits for a running mirror pass, and a pass cut
  off by a catalog switch removes the events it had just created —
  two more ways duplicates could appear.
- Going back to an earlier moment refuses if the catalog changed while
  its file was being saved, so nothing that arrived meanwhile is lost.
- Moving a cat or clowder to another catalog writes all of it or
  nothing on the receiving side.
- Folder sync skips a partner file a cloud client is still writing
  instead of stopping at it.
- A photo taken or shared while the catalog was switched away is
  dropped instead of crashing on the closed catalog; archiving checks
  the same before deleting.
- Two files opened in quick succession are imported one after the
  other instead of stacking two catalog dialogs.
- On the in-person sync page, a second tap on Host during startup does
  nothing, and backing out mid-start stops the server and hotspot.
- The card decodes its photo at card size; the image behind "share as
  picture" is released after use; the clowder card's PDF carries 240 px
  roster thumbnails instead of full photos.
- The flier wizard's thumbnails and the share preview are decoded at
  their display size.
- The map's tile folder is trimmed to 200 MB, oldest tiles first.
- A typed pair code pointing outside the local network is refused
  before anything is sent; a sync partner can only send photos the
  catalog mentions; an image whose header claims more than 40 million
  pixels is refused before decoding; map tiles are capped and cached
  only once they decoded.
- Files shared into the app get unique names and are deleted after the
  import.
- Photos of a switched-away catalog leave memory at once; a calendar
  that never answers releases the mirror after two minutes; the map
  and the celebration sound release what they hold.
- Two joiners at once are served one after the other; the automatic
  backup runs once per pause; imports, merges, the flier wizard's save
  and appointment groups land as one transaction; a photo file is
  written completely or not at all; the catalog list waits while a
  catalog is being written out for deletion.
- A location fix that never arrives gives up after 20 seconds with "no
  fix" instead of waiting for the rest of the session.
- An error from the phone's calendar during the mirror switched the app
  to the crash screen on every start; the mirror now turns itself off
  and shows the calendar's message.
- The crop screen after taking a photo decoded the full camera file
  twice; it now reads the size from the header and shows a screen-size
  preview.
- Clowder pins on the map decoded their photo at full size on every
  redraw.
- Photos shared into the app are read one at a time instead of all at
  once.
- "Stream has been disposed" while many photos were on screen (an iPad
  with a wide layout): a photo keeps the same image identity even after
  the small cache let it go.

- Pressing Stray Cam again while the GPS fix was still pending crashed
  the app on return from the camera ("Image picker is already active").
- Scrubbing through a filmed video on an iPad could end in "Stream has
  been disposed": the frame picker now keeps one image per frame and
  decodes a preview before showing it.
- Filming with Stray Cam (press and hold) killed the app on iPhones:
  the frame picker held a dozen full-size frames at once. It now works
  at preview size and fetches only the kept frames at photo size.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Date fields take a year or a month and year when the day is unknown
  — "2021" or "May 2021" is stored and shown as such, never as an
  invented first day. The flier wizard reads such dates from posters.
- A cat's age next to its birth date and in the strays list — "3 yrs
  5 mo", "3 yrs" for a bare birth year, frozen at death.
- The flier wizard can attach the poster to a cat or a clowder already
  in the catalog: pick them on the Cat page, and the poster's lines go
  where you assign them — clowder fields (address, phone, mail…) are
  in the dropdown too — with a note under any line that would
  overwrite a value.
- One cat list everywhere cats are listed — Strays, the cat search, a
  clowder's members via the list button on its page: list or table,
  sortable, with the cat fields you choose as columns, an Age column,
  and a text filter over names and values. The search now starts from
  all cats.
- A `.catsync` opened from a chat or a file manager asks which catalog
  it goes into before importing — any catalog, or a new one named
  from the file, so a cat you only want to look at stays out of your
  own data. Cancel leaves the file alone.
- "Find address on the map" under a clowder's address turns it into
  the clowder's position and names the place it found. The flier
  wizard's button now shows the found place too.

### Changed

- A stray's flier position shows on the map as a square pin with its
  face; sightings stay round. A cat known only from its poster is on
  the map now.
- "Show on map" from a cat's or clowder's page marks that spot with a
  highlighted pin. Cats of a clowder without a position pin at their
  own sightings. Cats sighted within 20 m of each other share one pin
  — one face, the name and "+2" — that opens the list of those cats.
- The card's QR code for a registry number (TASSO and the like) carries
  the registry's search link, so a phone camera opens the search;
  the caption still shows the number.
- The flier wizard's Flier text page offers "Drop" for any line, and a
  line sent to remarks arrives as its value alone — the poster's labels
  ("Geschlecht:") no longer fill the cat's and owner's remarks.
- The calendar mirror no longer recreates an event you deleted by hand
  in the phone's calendar; your edits there stay until the plan
  changes in the app or you resync.
- Dates are typed — "14.05.2021", "05.2021" or "2021" — with the
  calendar behind an icon instead of a month grid filling the dialog.
  Reminders, appointments and "as of" dates use the same entry.

### Fixed

- The calendar mirror wrote the same appointment into the phone's
  calendar again and again — two syncs running at once each created
  it. One sync runs at a time now, and events are written once and
  only updated when the plan changes. "Resync calendar" in the agenda
  menu removes every event cat(a)log wrote and writes the plans fresh
  — the way to clear the duplicates.

- The birth date printed on a TASSO poster fills the Birth date field
  instead of landing in remarks.
- Switching the catalog while the calendar mirror was still talking to
  the phone's calendar crashed the app ("database has already been
  closed").

## [1.0.5] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- Appointments in the phone's calendar were two hours late: the time
  entered is now written as local time.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- The calendar mirror on Android found no calendar although the phone
  had several; the picker now lists them.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Appointments: a visit with date, time, what, and notes — several per
  cat or clowder. The "+" on the agenda and the alarm button on a cat's
  or clowder's page ask "Appointment or reminder?" first. Finishing an
  appointment asks how it went, keeps the notes on the cat's timeline,
  and can write a value into a field. Several cats can share one
  appointment — a fosterer's neutering run: tick the cats in it, the
  agenda shows one card with their names, and finishing asks which cats
  were treated; the unticked ones stay planned. The calendar mirror adds
  appointments as timed events with an alert of your choice — the day
  before, an hour before, or none; a shared appointment is one event.
  The calendar file from the agenda menu carries appointments too, timed
  and with their alarm.

### Changed

- Capturing a flier starts on a "Flier text" page: QR codes found on the
  poster are listed and can be unticked, and every recognized line shows
  the field it goes to and can be moved to another one before anything
  is filled in.
- TASSO posters are read by their layout: name, registry number,
  missing-since date, address, gender, breed, colour and neutered land in
  their fields, and the registry's hotline no longer becomes the owner's
  phone. Layouts come from a template file the app ships, so other
  registries can be added without a code change.
- A flier can be saved only from its last page; the back button asks
  before the scan is thrown away.

### Fixed

- Flier text printed in two columns no longer arrives as all labels
  followed by all values.
- A QR code that could not be read says so, with the reader's error,
  instead of looking like a poster without a code.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- The tips and the help page for the agenda, reminders and the
  calendar switch say plainly what each thing does.

### Fixed

- The calendar picker lists every calendar the phone has; read-only
  ones are shown greyed instead of the whole list being reported as
  empty.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- "Add reminder" on cat and clowder pages and on the agenda: one
  dialog with field, due date, value and what a reminder is. Fields
  that state what a cat is — gender, breed, birth date, chip ID and
  the like — take no reminders.
- A "Planned" section on cat and clowder pages shows their live plans,
  with the same done, change-date and remove actions as the agenda —
  a plan on a field without a value is visible there too.

### Changed

- The reminder checkbox in the field editor is gone, and the "as of"
  date can no longer lie in the future — plans are made with Add
  reminder.
- The agenda has its own bell in the home bar on every screen size;
  Fields moved into the home menu.
- The calendar mirror is a visible switch at the top of the agenda. It
  asks which of the phone's calendars to use instead of creating a
  hidden local one, and says why when it cannot write — permission
  blocked, no calendar chosen, calendar gone.
- Tips introduce the agenda bell, Add reminder, the agenda's plus
  button and the calendar switch on first sight; the agenda has its own
  help page.

### Fixed

- Lists under a floating button scroll clear of it, so the last rows
  can be reached (Fields, Strays, Agenda).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Reminders: any field value can carry a future due date as a plan. A
  plan never becomes a fact — marking it done records the real
  treatment and can schedule the next cycle in days, weeks, months or
  years.
- Agenda: everything due across all cats and clowders in one dated
  list; overdue stays pinned on top until handled, and the agenda opens
  by itself when something is due within 3 days.
- Calendar: an opt-in mirror puts every due date into a cat(a)log
  calendar on the phone as an all-day event, and a calendar file
  (.ics) can be exported anywhere.
- A small cat ear in the corner marks everything that reacts to
  press-and-hold — cat tiles now open their menu on long-press too. A
  one-time tip explains the ear.

### Changed

- The map's buttons moved into one toolbar below the map: stray areas,
  my location, previous/next pin, and Stray Cam in one row — nothing
  covers the map anymore.
- Managing catalogs: tapping a catalog switches to it and stays on the
  screen, so several catalogs can be handled in one visit; the back
  button leaves.
- The sync format now carries reminders. Syncing and file exchange
  with 0.3.x devices keep working until the first reminder is used;
  from then on the other devices must update.

### Fixed

- The map no longer crashes ("Infinity or NaN toInt") when a search
  finds several hits on the same spot — and a map already stuck in
  that crash frees itself on the first open after this update.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Clowder card: a card icon on the clowder opens it as a card — its cats
  with their pictures on top, every detail selectable — shareable as an
  image or PDF and printable, like the cat card.

### Changed

- "Forever home" is now the plain word for home in every translation,
  instead of a literal word-for-word rendering.
- The support-the-developer note and a few capture-flier hints are
  reworded in all languages.

### Fixed

- The in-person sync host instructions now describe the actual flow —
  scan or type the code — instead of an address and PIN entry that no
  longer exists.
- While hosting an in-person sync, scanning and code entry are disabled,
  so a device can no longer sync with itself.
- The flier owner step said the owner becomes a card; it becomes a
  clowder.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Privacy is set per value, in the field editor: a checkmark keeps that
  one value in this catalog. The lock at the end of a row shows what is
  private. Marking a whole cat or clowder private is gone.
- The sync screen and Share publicly name the catalog that is shared,
  and the three sync ways introduce themselves in one line each.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Private now hides values, not cats and clowders. A private cat or
  clowder still reaches the people you sync with by name — what stays
  home is its address, its phone number, its photos. Single values can
  be kept back one at a time, with the lock beside the field, and a
  value someone kept back shows as withheld instead of as empty.

### Fixed

- Installing on Linux with Homebrew puts cat(a)log in the application
  menu, with its icon, and lets .catsync files open with it.
- What arrived after a sync or an import no longer counts the Fields
  themselves: an empty catalog arrives as nothing at all instead of as
  dozens of changes.
- A cat living in a private clowder arrives whole instead of vanishing:
  it used to reach the other device pointing at a clowder that was never
  sent, and then showed up on no screen at all.
- Sharing privately after sharing publicly reaches the other device.
  What was held back once used to stay unreachable for good, however
  often you shared again with private data included.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Several catalogs on one device. The home screen's title names the
  catalog you are in; tapping it switches, adds one, or renames one.
  Each catalog keeps its own cats, clowders, fields, photos and sync
  partners, while your name, your language and the tips you have seen
  are shared by all of them. Deleting a catalog writes a complete file
  where the automatic backups go before anything is removed, and asks
  you to type its name. Each catalog's automatic backup is its own file,
  named after the catalog.
- Moving a cat, a whole clowder with everything living in it, or a
  selection of strays into another catalog. What moves arrives with its
  whole history and its photos and is deleted where it came from, and
  creating a catalog offers to move something into it straight away.
- Undoing an import. The summary that appears after importing a file
  offers to take it back: what arrived is removed, written to a file
  first so importing that puts it back, and syncing with the same person
  again does not bring it straight back.
- A "Go back" list per catalog, in Manage catalogs: the moments the
  catalog changed shape, as sentences, newest first and grouped by
  month. Picking one returns the catalog to that state, and you can mark
  a moment yourself with a name. A moment is recorded before every
  import and every sync, before merging and before archiving — and a
  sync that finds nothing new records nothing.

### Changed

- On a tablet or a desktop window, the clowder table uses the whole
  width instead of being squeezed into the list column; opening a row
  shows the clowder over the table.
- Tutorial tips sit beside what they highlight instead of stretching
  across the screen, and no longer draw an arrow that pointed at empty
  space on tablets.

### Fixed

- On a tablet or a desktop window, Strays, Search, Find duplicates and
  Fields open beside the list of clowders instead of covering it.
- Long cat and clowder names are readable on a phone again: the title
  moved to its own line instead of being cut to a few letters by the
  buttons beside it.
- Entries written after deleting an author's data reach the people you
  sync with again, instead of being silently ignored as something they
  already had.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Photos can be shared into cat(a)log from any other app — Immich,
  Signal, a browser — single or a whole batch: pick the cat they belong
  to, or a new stray (Android).

- **Map, five wishes granted**: a my-location button; the map reopens
  where you left it; toggled stray areas show the missing cat's tappable
  face on every flier spot; searching an unknown name falls back to a
  place search ("Leipzig" now works, and the map zooms in on the found
  street or town instead of centering it in a country-wide view); and
  two arrows glide from pin to pin in nearest-neighbor order.

- **Archive old data** (About → Archive): deceased cats and empty
  clowders that have been quiet for years are written into a .catsync
  file you keep and then deleted — on your device and on every device
  you sync with. Importing the file brings them back. The page also
  shows what the catalog currently costs in database and photo space.
  Importing such a file into the catalog it came from asks whether the
  deleted entries should be restored — photos included.

- **Help on every page**: a "?" in the app bar explains what the page
  is for, what you can do there, and what tap and long-press do — plus a
  button that shows that page's tips again.

- **Flier scan is a wizard**: cat, owner, face crop, registry, and a
  final check — one step per page, so the profile picture and the
  poster's contact details no longer get skipped by accident. Phone and
  e-mail land in the owner's own fields, and the address can be turned
  into a position for the owner's card.

- Registry numbers from a poster: an ID field can carry a lookup link,
  so a Tasso number found on a flier is stored with the cat and opens
  the service in one tap. Links from other services are learned from
  the poster — name it once and the next flier fills itself.

- Clowders have Email and Phone fields — contacting the people behind a
  colony no longer means writing it into Remarks.

- The home a stray ran from counts as a search area of its own: its
  clowder's location gets the same 500 m circle on the map, and cats
  seen inside it turn up under possible matches.

- **Clowders as a table**: a toggle in the clowder overview switches
  between tiles and a sortable table — Name, Cats, and any clowder
  fields as columns of your choosing, strays pinned first; view, columns,
  and sorting are remembered per device.

### Changed

- Chip scanning is labeled "Scan printed code" and explains that the
  implanted chip itself can't be read by a phone.
- Dates display in the device's format everywhere (27.12.2010 instead
  of 2010-12-27).
- The Messenger sync card says it also imports received .catsync files.
- The intro pages, the tips and the sharing explanations are written in
  plain language: what each screen does and what happens when you tap.

### Fixed

- Crash reports name the app version and build, the system and its
  version, the language and the time — the old ones left the version
  blank, so nobody could tell which build had crashed.
- Mother and Father print the linked cat's name on the card instead
  of an internal id; a link that no longer resolves is left off.
- "Share publicly" honors Private everywhere: a private cat refuses to
  export (with the reason), a private clowder and private fields stay
  out of the share file and QR.
- Merging from Match candidates or Find duplicates asks the same
  cannot-be-undone confirmation as every other merge.
- Match candidates no longer pair up cats living in the same clowder —
  geo matching considers strays and missing cats only.
- Cat and clowder pages refresh immediately after a revert on the
  timeline or photos extracted from a video — no reopening needed.
- Scrubbing through a video shows the frame at the current position
  right away, not only after keeping it.
- With 3-button navigation the system bar no longer floats over the
  app's bottom buttons.
- A chip barcode on the Card appears once: the code with its printed
  number, without the repeating fact row and caption (QR codes keep one
  caption line, they carry no readable number).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Private cats, clowders, and fields**: marked private, they never leave
  your device unless you explicitly include private data in a sync — every
  sync asks, the default is always public-only.
- **A trust question before syncing**: the hosting device shows who wants
  to connect and asks Allow / Always allow / Decline before anything flows.
  Always-allowed devices are listed under About → Authors & bans.
- **Hide what you don't care about**: cats, clowders, and fields can be
  hidden on your device only — the data keeps syncing for everyone else,
  and "Show hidden" brings anything back.
- **Choose what's on a card**: tick photo, home, and fields before sharing;
  the position is never on a card unless you put it there.
- **Family**: mother and father can be set on every cat; the cat page shows
  littermates, siblings, and kittens, all tappable.
- **Clowder type** (foster home, forever home, clinic, shelter, barn,
  owner — or your own words) shown as colored chips.
- **Adoption party**: moving a cat into a forever home throws confetti and
  a cheer (About page switch turns it off).
- **What arrived after a sync**: a summary lists adopted, deceased,
  escaped, and new animals plus conflicts to resolve — and little toasts
  announce adoptions and births (deaths, escapes, and moves can be enabled
  too).
- **Search on the map**: find cats, clowders, and people from your catalog;
  the position picker gained a place/address search and opens at your
  location instead of a country map.
- **Cat name proposals**: new cats arrive with a suggested name from a big
  list of classics, ancient names, and jokes — the dice rerolls; no name is
  proposed twice.
- **Remove a person's data for good**: About → Authors & bans deletes
  everything an author wrote from this device and can ban them and their
  photos from ever coming back — for the day someone poisons the catalog.
- **Received .catsync files open directly** in the import screen also on
  iPhone/iPad, Linux, and Windows (via Scoop) — no longer Android only.
- **Sync without any Wi-Fi** between two Android phones: one hosts a
  temporary hotspot, the other scans one QR code — connects, syncs, and
  disconnects by itself.
- **A real desktop layout**: wide windows (and iPad landscape) show the
  clowder list and details side by side; windows remember their size;
  Ctrl+F searches, Esc goes back, right-click opens context menus.
- **A short intro** on first start (skippable, replayable from About) —
  now with a missing-cats page — and small **what's-new spotlights** that
  point out each new feature once: the strays card, the edit pencil, the
  flier and share tools, the map overlay, and the duplicates finder.
- **Clowder cards show who lives there**: cat faces, a count, and the
  type as a small label on the card's edge.

- **ID fields**: a new field type for identifiers — typed, or scanned
  from a PRINTED QR/barcode (chip card, vet papers; the implanted chip
  itself can't be read by a phone). Shown on the Card as plain text, QR
  code, or barcode as chosen at field creation. Cats start with a
  **Chip ID** field rendered as a barcode.

- **Remarks**: a multiline notes field on every cat and clowder; search
  finds cats by their remarks too.
- **Flier capture**: photograph a missing-cat flier and it becomes an
  owner clowder plus a missing cat that went stray on the flier's date —
  with the flier photo as provenance, an optional cropped portrait as the
  face, the location as a flier position, and scanned or recognized text
  prefilling chip ID, phone, and remarks (text recognition on Android and
  iOS, Latin-script text only; editable everywhere). "Add flier" on a cat appends further fliers.
- **Match candidates**: a screen listing cats that might be the same
  animal — exact chip/ID matches first, then cats seen within 500 m of a
  flier or of each other, filterable by species. Confirming a pair is the
  familiar merge, with the survivor of your choice.
- **Find duplicates**: a scan for likely twins among cats and clowders —
  same or nearly-same names, equal chip IDs — resolved pair by pair
  through the familiar merge.
- **Photos from video** (Android/iPhone): pick a video — or long-press
  Stray Cam to film one — and keep the good frames as ordinary photos.
  The app suggests the sharpest frames, a scrubber grabs any moment, and
  the video itself is never stored. No frame kept, no cat.
- **Share publicly for fliers**: export one cat with only the fields you
  tick as an ordinary sync file, print a QR of its hosted link (or a tiny
  text-only inline QR that needs no hosting) — a finder scans it with
  cat(a)log, sees a preview with the source, and imports the cat and its
  owner's contact with one tap. Partial imports are safe: a later real
  sync still delivers everything that stayed home, and references to cats
  not included simply wait until they arrive.
- **Possible stray area**: toggle a 500 m circle overlay around a missing
  cat's flier positions on the map — the radius most lost cats are found
  within.
- Positions now know their kind: live sightings versus flier locations.
  Flier positions never appear as sighting pins, and a stray without any
  sighting is valid — it lives in lists and search, just not on the map.

- Plausibility now also guards the family: a female father or male
  mother, a parent born after its kitten, and gender changes that
  contradict recorded parenthood are refused with the reason.

- Cards show a scannable geo QR plus the printable Plus Code for a cat's
  location — any phone's camera opens it in its maps app.

### Changed

- The "Position" starter field is now labeled **Location**.
- Saving a captured flier shows a spinner, a nameless owner is named
  after the cat ("Owner of Minka"), and the owner card carries the
  flier's text and phone itself.

- Cat and clowder pages open read-only showing only filled fields, nicely
  formatted; the pencil switches to the full edit view, and renaming lives
  there too. Clowders lead with their cat gallery, long-pressing a field
  jumps straight into editing it, and new fields can be created right on
  the page. Freshly created cats open in edit mode, ready to fill in.
- Strays appear as their own card first in the clowder grid — cover
  photo, count, and faces — instead of a button below the list; the stray
  list shows gender and color and sorts by name, gender, or color.
- The sync page became three clear choices: **In person** (same room, QR),
  **Remote** (shared folder), **Messenger** (one file). Options that can't
  work right now say why instead of failing later.
- Positions show as "on the map" with a jump button — raw coordinates are
  gone from the app.
- Deceased cats appear dimmed with a small dated note instead of vanishing
  among the living.
- Map pins show faces and homes: photoless cats get a drawn cat silhouette
  and clowders show their own photo; the house icon is only a placeholder.
- Fields of different types can now be merged — the surviving field's type
  wins, old values stay readable.
- Error messages name the problem: "Couldn't reach the other device — are
  both on the same Wi-Fi?" instead of raw error codes.

### Fixed

- Clowder photos now travel through shared-folder and file syncs (they
  previously only arrived over direct Wi-Fi sync).
- The map's long-press sheet shows each stray's photo instead of a row of
  identical paw icons.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Implausible starter-field values are refused with an explanation: birth or death dates in the future, death before birth, and pregnancy for a male cat.

### Fixed

- The month arrows in date fields no longer skip several months per tap.
- Android no longer offers cat(a)log when opening calendar links.
- Typing a date now shows the expected format when the input doesn't parse.
- Sharing photos, cards, sync bundles, and the CSV export works on iPad.
- Fixed an occasional crash while photos were still loading.
- Location features explain why no position is available (service off, permission denied, no GPS fix) and open the right settings screen.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- The option list of a choice field (e.g. Breed) can be edited from the
  Fields screen.

### Changed

- The map no longer rotates on a two-finger twist; north stays up.

### Fixed

- No more crash when returning to the app after the system camera (or
  any other screen change) finished while the app was in the background.
- Stray Cam no longer loses the photo when Android closes the app behind
  the camera — the capture completes on the next start.
- Stray Cam creates the cat only once a photo was actually taken, so a
  canceled camera no longer leaves an empty stray behind.
- When location access is permanently blocked, Stray Cam explains it and
  offers to open the system settings instead of failing quietly.
- Opening a `.catsync` file now actually imports it — 0.1.2 only made
  the app appear in the chooser.
- Breed choices display in the device language (e.g. "Europäisch
  Kurzhaar" on German devices).
- A failed automatic backup is shown on the Sync screen instead of
  disappearing silently.
- Each Sync-screen section shows its own result — a folder sync no
  longer reports under the QR section.
- Swiping through the full-screen gallery no longer flickers.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- The app can be installed via F-Droid from the project's own repository.
- Cats have a Breed field with common breeds as choices.
- Choice fields accept a freely typed value besides the preset options.
- Tapping a cat photo opens it full-screen with zoom and swiping; the
  photo menu (profile, crop, mark, delete) moved to long-press.
- Photos can be shared or saved from the full-screen view.
- Android offers cat(a)log when opening a `.catsync` file from a
  messenger or file app.

### Changed

- Crop and Mark screens confirm with a labeled button ("Crop" / "Save")
  instead of a bare checkmark.

### Removed

- Placing an existing clowder from the map's long-press menu — a
  clowder's position is set via its Position field.

### Fixed

- The automatic backup keeps its `.catsync` name instead of being renamed
  to `.zip`, replaces the previous backup instead of piling up copies,
  and cleans up old `.zip` leftovers.
- A fresh install no longer overwrites the surviving backup with an
  empty one.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Crashes show a friendly restart-and-report screen instead of the app
  simply vanishing.

### Fixed

- The map no longer force-closes (out of memory) after adding a stray or
  zooming: tile providers are reused and cat avatars downscaled.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-15

Milestone M1: local-only catalog with Cards.

### Added

- Walking skeleton: Flutter app (Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, macOS) with a
  pure-Dart catalog core — append-only entry log over SQLite, latest-wins
  projection, dated and authored history for every change.
- First-launch Author setup; every entry is attributed to the device's Author.
- Clowders: create, rename, list; address and responsible person as ordinary
  Field values with history.
- Starter Field definitions seeded on first launch (gender, color, neutered,
  pregnant, birth date, deceased, address, responsible person).
- Cats: create inside a Clowder with name and photo, multiple photos per Cat,
  automatic compression on import (2560 px long edge), content-addressed image
  storage, Profile Image (defaults to the first photo, choosable), Clowder
  view as a grid of cat faces.
- Typed Field editing on Cats and Clowders (text, yes/no, date, number,
  choice) with backdating ("as of" date on every edit), full timeline per Cat
  and Clowder, and per-Field history via long-press.
- User-defined global Fields: create your own Field with name, type, scope
  (cats/clowders/both), and options for choice fields — usable immediately,
  no app update needed.
- Move & Stray: move a Cat to another Clowder (adoption) or record it leaving
  with no destination; Strays list on the home screen; every Move appears in
  the timeline.
- Cards: one screen with photo, name, and current facts per Cat — share as
  image, export as PDF (A5), or print directly.
- Deletes: photos (data really gone once no Cat shows them), Cats (hidden
  everywhere, photos dropped), and Clowders (their Cats fall out as Strays).
- Search: find a Cat by name (case-insensitive) across all Clowders and
  Strays, with face, name, and current location in the results.
- CI: GitHub Actions pipeline — analyze + tests on Linux, release APK
  artifact, unsigned iOS build; separate TestFlight workflow (signed build
  and upload) ready for the Apple credentials.
- Android release signing (own upload keystore, debug fallback for local
  builds) and a tag-driven Release workflow attaching signed per-ABI and
  universal APKs to GitHub Releases.
- Home screen shows Clowders as photo cards (two per row, sorted by name,
  faded cat photo background, shadowed name).
- Strays can be created directly from the Strays screen.
- Field definitions can be renamed (typo fixes); values and history stay
  attached, the rename itself is recorded history.
- Revert from history, git-style: any regular change (rename, field value,
  move) can be reverted; the previous value is appended as a new entry at
  the current time and both change and undo remain visible.
- Clowder timelines show which Cat lived there when: arrivals and
  departures ("Miezi arrived from A", "left to Adopter") derived from the
  Cats' membership histories; Cat timelines render moves readably too.
- App icon: a Karteikarte with a cat face — generated for Android
  (including adaptive), iOS, Windows, and macOS from assets/icon/icon.svg.
- Device-to-device sync over the local network: host shows address + PIN,
  joiner syncs two ways (entries and photos, delta only) — no server, no
  account; every device converges to identical state.
- Conflict handling: concurrent edits of the same field are detected at
  sync (causally, via version vectors), badged amber, and resolved by
  choosing a value — the choice is a new history entry, nothing is lost.
- Merge for duplicates of all kinds — Cats, Clowders, Fields (same type):
  pick the survivor, the other record folds in alias-style with full
  history; late-syncing edits against the merged record land on the
  survivor.
- Desktop: Linux and Windows bundles built in CI and attached to releases.
- iOS permission strings for camera, photo library, and local network.
- Shared-folder sync: any cloud-drive or USB folder carries the catalog
  between devices that never meet — each device writes only its own file.
- Map (OpenStreetMap): Strays and Clowders as pins, offline cache of
  visited tiles, long-press to place a clowder or record a sighting.
- Stray Cam: one tap registers a stray at the current GPS position with a
  photo; "seen here now" records sightings of any cat.
- Movement trails: tap a stray's pin to see its dated positions connected
  on the map.
- CSV export of all cats via the share sheet (RFC 4180).
- About & feedback screen: version, source link, GitHub issues, mail,
  open-source licenses, and a donation link (hidden on iOS per App Store
  rules).
- 38 languages, machine-translated (corrections welcome on GitHub), with
  right-to-left support for Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew; starter Field names
  and values translate per device language while the data stays canonical
  (ADR-0005); dates follow the device locale.
- Crop: a skippable crop step when importing photos (Stray Cam skips it),
  and "Crop…" on any photo — the cropped copy joins as a new photo, the
  original stays, so one litter photo serves several cats.
- Mark: drag an ellipse over one cat and a highlight is baked into a copy
  — for tangled kittens no crop can separate; prints like any photo.
- Desktop installs via Homebrew (`brew install --cask paxel/tap/catlog`,
  macOS dmg per architecture) and Scoop (`scoop install catlog`, Windows);
  Linux tar.gz for x86_64 and arm64 on every release.

- Pairing for device sync: hosting shows a QR code and a short typable
  code (auto-grouped, forgiving of case and look-alike characters);
  joining scans or types it and syncs immediately — no more IP + PIN
  fields. Hint for using a phone hotspot when there is no shared Wi-Fi.
- Sync by messenger: send the whole catalog as one file through WhatsApp,
  Signal, or mail; the other side imports it — cross-city sync, still no
  server.
- Position fields open a map picker (tap the spot or use GPS) instead of
  asking for coordinates.
- Creating clowders, cats, and strays and moving cats now ask "as of"
  which date — records that are years old carry their real dates.
- In-app language picker (all 38 languages, by native name).
- Donation link points to ko-fi.com/paxel7.
- Automatic uninstall-proof backup: leaving the app writes the full
  catalog as a sync bundle to Downloads/catlog (Android) or the Downloads
  folder (desktop) whenever something changed; restore via "Import sync
  bundle". Uninstalling the app can no longer lose your cats.

### Fixed

- Deterministic ordering could disagree between devices when a timestamp
  had exactly zero microseconds (variable-precision ISO strings compare
  wrongly); timestamps now store fixed precision, existing databases are
  repaired on open.
